  ## Description
  This application allows users to interact with information stored in a mySQL database. The content management system uses inquirer to prompt the user through a clean CLI user interface. The users input is used to make updates to the database. Use this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/zHnyrxzJL0rF4VKKNwWpQR/module12Flow?node-id=40%3A89&t=z7ELt4hw2RyrtqLH-1) to see a visual explanation of the branching prompts.
